# Web Design Project

![Project Overview](./Video.gif)

This is a modern web design project built using React and Material UI, with animations and responsiveness integrated. The application is deployed on [Vercel](https://webdesign-project-beta.vercel.app/) and is based on designs created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/z6p9FI179kUbwgmjG68C1K/Design-Project?node-id=0-1&t=fLXvnmc1hVkfOCkr-1).

## Overview

This project showcases advanced frontend development skills, combining interactive animations, responsive design, and UI/UX principles. It highlights how to manage complex animations and layouts with React, CSS animations, and Material UI's theming system.

## Features

- **Letter-by-letter animations**: Custom animations for individual letters using Material UI's `Typography` component and CSS keyframes.
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with MUI's theme breakpoints and responsive typography.
- **Custom components**: Modular and reusable components like `MovingLetter` and `AvailableButton` for scalable UI development.
- **Dynamic animations**: Use of `useState` to control when animations start and stop dynamically.

## Frontend Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights a wide range of skills needed for modern frontend development, particularly in React-based applications:

1. **React.js**:

   - Functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useTheme`), state management, and component-driven architecture.

2. **Material UI (MUI)**:

   - Theming, responsive design, custom styling (`sx` prop), and component customization with `Typography`, `Box`, and `Button`.

3. **CSS Keyframe Animations**:

   - Implementing complex letter-by-letter animations and transitions (e.g., `move-up`, `lose-width`), controlling animation delays and durations dynamically.

4. **Responsive Design**:

   - Usage of Material UI's theme breakpoints and CSS units like `vh` to ensure the app looks good on both desktop and mobile.

5. **Git and Deployment**:

   - Version control with Git and continuous deployment using Vercel, making the project accessible online with automatic updates on push.

6. **Figma to Code Integration**:
   - Translating design specs from Figma into responsive, pixel-perfect frontend code.
